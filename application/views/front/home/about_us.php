                <h4>Welcome to Always Reliable Key </h4>
                <p>Always Reliable Keys (ARK) was created to assist automotive locksmiths and vehicle security professionals who are tired of having to consult multiple references or systems before taking on an automotive key job. Right now, you look up what keys and remotes are compatible with the car, then you check to see if you have them in-stock. Next you grab your application guide for the diagnostic tool you own to find out if you can program the remotes and keys to the car and if there is anything special you need to know, like is a pin-code required etc. At ARK, we get it. That’s why we created the easy to read dashboard where you can instantly see all the information you need to know before taking on any job.</p>
                <p>Knowledge and resources are critical to success for automotive locksmiths. Let Always Reliable Keys help you become better and more efficient at making and programming car keys!</p>

                    <p>Steven is a 2nd generation locksmith who has been learning and performing the skills of the trade for the last 12 years. In 2010 Steven saw the need and opportunity for growth in automotive keys in his market and began educating himself and investing in the tools and equipment required to keep up with the new keys and remotes being introduced by the auto manufacturers. In 2016 Steven needed a better system to help his growing business be more efficient and professional in making and programming transponder keys and remotes, so he designed and created Always Reliable Keys as an in-house application to be used in his shop. After seeing the success this application brought to his business, he decided to overhaul the application and make it more robust and user friendly and is now introducing this system as a subscription-based web application available to all automotive locksmith.</p>
