                <p>Stay on top of your inventory with this simple inventory tracking software. To start, add items from our extensive database of global parts into your inventory. The Move section allows you to move or keep track of where your inventory is located (i.e. Move from Work Van 1 to Shop). Inventory receival provides an organized way of adding new, in-stock, or out-of-stock inventory to your records. Each item is adjustable and trackable, and you can always see a history of locations and sales. Finally, anything in your inventory can be added straight to your estimates and invoices, and the quantity will automatically be adjusted to reflect whatâ€™s really in stock.</p>
